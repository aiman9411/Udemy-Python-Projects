# Turtle Crossing Game

Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game! This is a simple yet fun game where the player helps a turtle navigate through a busy road. The objective is to get the turtle across the road safely without colliding with any cars.

## Features

- **Player Controls**: Use the keyboard to move the turtle up across the screen.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Cars of different colors move across the screen at varying speeds.
- **Level Progression**: Each time the turtle successfully crosses to the other side, the game level increases, and car speeds increment, making the game progressively harder.

## How to Play

- **Move Up**: Press the "Up" arrow key to move the turtle forward.
- **Restart**: If the turtle collides with a car, the game will restart automatically.

The game continues indefinitely, with the difficulty increasing as you progress through levels.
