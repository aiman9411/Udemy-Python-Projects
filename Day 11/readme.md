# Blackjack Game

Welcome to the Blackjack Game! This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. The game allows you to play against the computer in an interactive manner.

## Game Rules

- Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to have a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it.
- Number cards are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
- Aces worth 11.
- A hand with an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, King) is called a Blackjack and is an automatic win unless the dealer also has a Blackjack.
- The dealer must draw cards until their hand value is 17 or higher.

## Features

- Draw cards to build your hand and try to get as close to 21 as possible.
- The computer acts as the dealer, drawing cards according to the rules.
- Interactive prompts guide you through each step of the game.
- ASCII art enhances the visual experience of the game.
