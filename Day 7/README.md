## Description

The Hangman Game is a fun and interactive word guessing game where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. The project is divided into three files:

1. **hangman.py**: The main script that runs the game logic.
2. **hangman_words.py**: Contains a list of words used in the game.
3. **hangman_art.py**: Contains ASCII art used for visual representation in the game.
